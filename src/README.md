# keystone-kerberos

This subordinate charm provides a way to authenticate in Openstack for 
a specific domain with a Kerberos ticket. This provides an additional 
security layer. An external Kerberos server is necessary.

This kerberos subordinate charm is supported on Ubuntu Bionic (18.04 LTS) with 
the Openstack versions Queens and later. 


# Usage

Use this charm with the Keystone charm:
    
    juju deploy keystone
    juju deploy openstack-dashboard
    juju deploy keystone-kerberos
    juju add-relation keystone openstack-dashboard
    juju add-relation keystone keystone-kerberos
    
In a bundle:

```
    applications
    # ...
      keystone-kerberos:
        charm: ../../../keystone-kerberos
        num_units: 0
        options:
          kerberos-realm: "PROJECT.SERVERSTACK"
          kerberos-server: "freeipa.project.serverstack"
          kerberos-domain: "k8s"
        resources:
          keystone_keytab: "/home/ubuntu/keystone.keytab"
      relations:
      # ...
      - - keystone
        - keystone-kerberos
```

# Prerequisites

To authenticate against Keystone and Kerberos from a host, the following 
librairies need to be installed :
- sudo apt install krb5-user python3-openstackclient python3-requests-kerberos

# Configuration

In the Kerberos server, a service must be created for the Keystone Principal. 
For example, first find the hostname of the keystone server :

    ubuntu@keystone-server$ hostname -f
    keystone-server.project.serverstack

Note 1 : make sure that your keystone server can resolve the Kerberos server 
hostname. If if can't, consider adding an entry to /etc/hosts. 

Then, in the Kerberos server, create the host and service (this example is 
based on a FreeIPA Kerberos Server):

    ipa host-add keystone-server.project.serverstack --ip-adress=10.0.0.2
    ipa service-add HTTP/keystone-server.project.serverstack
    ipa service-add-host HTTP/keystone-server.project.serverstack --hosts=keystone-server.project.serverstack

Note 2 : If you have multiple keystone servers, you should add each host to 
the principal with the command 

    ipa host-add-principal keystone-server HTTP/<keystone-other-hostname>@PROJECT.SERVERSTACK

Retrieve the keytab associated with this service:
    
    ipa-getkeytab -p HTTP/keystone-server.project.serverstack -k keystone.keytab
    
This is the keytab needed in the resources of the keystone-kerberos charm. If 
you retrieved it post-deploy, you can attach it with a command to keystone:

    juju attach-resource keystone-kerberos/0 keystone_keytab=new_keytab.keytab

# Authentication from a host

To use the Openstack cli, two steps are required. 
1) Retrieve a token for an existing user in the Kerberos/LDAP directory:
```
    kinit <username>
```
2) Source the openstack rc file with the correct information:
```
    cat k8s-user.rc
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://kerberos-server.project.serverstack:5000/krb/v3
    export OS_PROJECT_ID=<projectID>
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<kerberos_domain> # i.e k8s
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=<domainID>
    export OS_REGION_NAME="RegionOne"
    export OS_INTERFACE=public
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_AUTH_TYPE=v3kerberos

    source k8s-user.rc
    openstack token issue
```
